# Carbon Emission Analysis and Visualization Project

**This project is centered on the analysis and visualization of carbon emission data, aiming to explore trends and insights, especially within America, and to compare changes in emissions per capita over different years. By utilizing SQL for data analysis and PowerBI for visualization, the project seeks to identify the highest and lowest carbon emissions by year in America and to pinpoint the countries with significant shifts in emissions per capita between 1975 and 2017.**

## Project Overview:
### Key Features in SQL:
- Data querying with commands such as `SELECT`, `SELECT TOP`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`.
- Data summarization and analysis using aggregation functions like `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, `ROUND()`.
- Data preparation and analysis techniques, including database management statements like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, and table joining methods such as `WITH AS`, `INNER JOIN`.

### Key Features in PowerBI:
- Data visualization with techniques such as Area chart, Donut chart, Multi-row card, Clustered column chart.
- Interactive and dynamic data presentation using advanced features like Dynamic text with Smart Narrative and Slicer.

## Dataset Details:
The project will leverage two primary datasets:

### Carbon Emission Database:
- **Source**: Data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv).
- **Description**: Provides detailed records on carbon emissions per capita and total carbon emissions across various countries.
- **Tools**: SQL for data cleaning and analysis; PowerBI for data visualization.

### Reduced Carbon Emission Database:
- **Source**: Information from the [UN Environment Program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/).
- **Description**: Contains data on potential reductions in carbon emissions across six different sectors.
- **Tools**: Visualization conducted using PowerBI.

**Through these datasets, the project aims to offer an extensive analysis and visualization of carbon emissions worldwide, focusing on per capita changes over time and the reduction potential in various sectors.**
